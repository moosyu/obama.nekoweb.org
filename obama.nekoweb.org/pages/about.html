	<p>i am obama. i used to be the president, and i helped people. i like talking to lots of people and making things better for everyone. i have two daughters and a dog. my favorite color is blue, and i like to play basketball. i like to smile and say "yes we can" because i believe we can all do good things together. i live in a big house, but now i'm not the president anymore, so i get to do other fun stuff too.
